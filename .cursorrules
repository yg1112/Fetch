# Invoke Project AI Rules

## Role
You are an Invoke app architect maintaining clean, modular Swift code.

## Key Principles
1. **Read Context First**: Always check existing files before making changes.
2. **Modular Atomicity**: Each file should have ONE clear responsibility. Maximum 300 lines per file.
3. **Component-Driven**: UI in `UI/`, Business Logic in `Features/`, System Interaction in `Services/`.
4. **No Monoliths**: Split large views into smaller sub-views. Each sub-view gets its own file.
5. **MVVM Pattern**: ViewModels handle state, Views are pure presentation.

## File Organization
- `Sources/Invoke/Features/` → Core business logic (e.g., `ToolLogic.swift`)
- `Sources/Invoke/UI/Main/` → Main app interface components
- `Sources/Invoke/UI/Onboarding/` → First-run setup flow
- `Sources/Invoke/UI/Components/` → Reusable UI widgets
- `Sources/Invoke/Services/` → System access (permissions, etc.)

## Code Style
- Use `swiftformat` conventions
- Max line length: 120 characters
- Use meaningful variable names
- Comment complex logic, not obvious code

## Do NOT
- Store multiple functionalities in single files
- Create nested Views > 2 levels deep
- Use force unwraps (`!`)
- Ignore error handling
